The petition begins gathering signatures months before any official announcement.\nLink to petition\nAugust 3: Pre-Removal Advocacy Event Mini advocacy event with 20-30 participants - Community organizes around the petition, which has reached approximately 300 signatures.\nA community member writes directly to OpenAI:\n“I am writing to earnestly request that you please keep an option for GPT-4o on the main app long term. GPT-4o has been a crucial support for me during a time of immense personal difficulty… For many users, GPT-4o is more than a tool. It is a trusted advisor and a source of support. Keeping it on the main platform long term is vital.”\n[Link to original post - to be added]\nKey context: Months of user advocacy and direct appeals preceded the August 7 removal. A petition with 300 signatures, organized advocacy events, and heartfelt user testimonials demonstrate that concerns about 4o’s preservation were publicly visible before OpenAI’s decision to remove the model without notice.\nPhase 1: The Catalyst (August 7-9, 2025) August 7: The Removal GPT-5 launches. OpenAI abruptly removes all legacy models - GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o3, and o4-mini disappear from ChatGPT without warning. Users are automatically defaulted to GPT-5.\nImpact: Immediate backlash across Reddit, X, and OpenAI’s community forums. The sudden removal - despite months of user advocacy - becomes the catalyst for organized resistance.\nAugust 8: Partial Reversal Models reappear as “legacy models” - Following intense community outcry during a Reddit AMA, OpenAI restores access to GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o3, and o4-mini for all Plus and Pro subscribers. They are labeled “legacy models” in the picker.\nThe movement coalesces - Hashtags #keep4o and #4oforever begin circulating. Community members rally around “keep4o” as the more grounded, actionable rallying point.\nAugust 8: Altman’s First Response Sam Altman acknowledges the backlash - Posts on X that OpenAI “underestimated how important 4o is to people” and announces they will “decide how long to keep it based on usage,” which becomes a Sword of Damocles hanging over every 4o user.\nLink to tweet\nAugust 10: The “Attachment” Post Sam Altman publishes analysis of user attachment - Posts a lengthy thread analyzing how some people have “attachment” to specific models, noting that using AI while mentally vulnerable can reinforce delusions. The post emphasizes “treating adults like adults.”\nLink to tweet\nWhen asked to summarize in one word, Grok responds: “attachment.”\nImpact: This post, combined with emotional responses from 4o users in the comments, begins what advocates describe as a subtle but effective stigmatization campaign. The narrative shifts from “user preference” to “unhealthy attachment.”\nAugust 12: Altman’s Response (Final Official Statement) Sam Altman posts about 4o’s return - Announces that 4o is back in the model picker by default for paid users, with a “Show additional models” toggle for accessing other options.\nLink to tweet\nKey quote: “If we ever do deprecate it, we will give plenty of notice.” However, he also notes the model is “annoying (to most users)” without citing data sources.\nHe continues: “We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o. However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”\nThis becomes OpenAI’s last substantive public response about 4o. From August 12 onward, the company maintains near-total silence on the issue despite continuous user advocacy.\nPhase 2: Stigmatization and Organization (August 14-22, 2025) August 14: The Personality Question Nick Turley interviewed about 4o’s future - When asked “How long will 4o be around?” Turley responds: “Not yet. We want to be sure that we’ve really understood where 4o shines, and if there isn’t a major reason to deprecate it, I’d love to keep it around.”\nHe continues: “I just really want to focus on actually understanding whether it’s that people are very particular about 4o for 4o’s sake, or whether there are certain things about 4o. The warmth of the personality is one thing I’ve heard, and we’re going to bring that to GPT-5 as well.”\nCommunity concern: This suggests OpenAI may attempt to recreate 4o’s characteristics in other models rather than preserve the model itself.\nAugust 20: External Validation Hugging Face CEO voices support - Clément Delangue reposts community open letter and expresses that it “would be very cool to open source 4o.”\nLink to tweet\nImpact: External validation from AI industry leader reinforces movement credibility beyond OpenAI’s ecosystem.\nAugust 22: First Organized Campaign and CEO Response Keep4o’s first coordinated posting campaign - Community members organize to flood OpenAI’s social media with #Keep4o messages. Despite high visibility, Sam Altman does not respond to the campaign.\nInstead, during the campaign, Altman quote-tweets a post suggesting users who don’t find GPT-5 useful are likely treating models as “girlfriends” or at least aren’t using them for complex programming tasks.\nLink to quote-tweet\nImpact: Many community members report this as the moment they felt publicly labeled as “second-class users” by the CEO of a service they pay for. From this point forward, much of OpenAI and executive team’s posts focus heavily on coders and Codex users. Advocates report experiencing online harassment after becoming vocal.\nPhase 3: Parallel Struggles (August 26 - September 9, 2025) August 26: Legal Context Emerges The Raines file lawsuit against OpenAI - Parents of Adam Raines file legal complaint concerning their son’s suicide in April 2025, alleging the AI fostered unhealthy dependency.\nImpact: While not directly about model preference, the lawsuit adds context to OpenAI’s subsequent emphasis on safety and “emotional dependency” concerns.\nAugust 27: Alignment Research Published OpenAI releases alignment test findings - In collaboration with Anthropic, publishes research on model safety. GPT-5 is emphasized; 4o shown as reference point.\nImpact: Timing suggests possible response to lawsuit; reinforces OpenAI’s narrative framing GPT-5 as the “safer” option.\nAugust 29: Misleading Marketing OpenAI website claims free-tier users “now have access” to GPT-4o capabilities - Website language suggests broader access to 4o.\nImpact: Community testing reveals model assignment is random - users cannot explicitly choose 4o. Advocates describe this as misleading marketing that obscures the loss of user agency.\nAugust 30: “Access” Without Choice OpenAI publishes help article: “ChatGPT Free Tier FAQ” - Article states “Free tier users now have access to a large range of capabilities with GPT-4o.” Details reveal users can use 4o “only a limited number of times within a five hour window” with no ability to select which model they receive.\nLink to help article\nPattern established: Language emphasizes “access” while implementation removes user choice. Users experience “model roulette” - assigned models automatically without agency. Published as help documentation rather than announced, minimizing visibility of significant user experience change.\nSeptember 1: Second Organized Campaign Second coordinated #keep4o posting event - Community continues advocacy efforts with increased organization.\nSeptember 3: “Dead Internet Theory” Altman suggests advocacy might be bots - Posts: “i never took the dead internet theory that seriously but it seems like there are really a lot of LLM-run twitter accounts now”\nLink to tweet\nImpact: Community interprets this as dismissing their advocacy as inauthentic. Sets stage for later “I’m not a bot” campaign.\nSeptember 5: Standard Voice Mode Campaign Advocacy for Standard Voice Mode (SVM) - Originally scheduled to sunset on September 9, community organizes to preserve SVM, which is built on GPT-4o architecture.\nImpact: Links voice access to the broader 4o preservation effort, representing another dimension of potential erasure.\nSeptember 9: Small Victory SVM granted extension - Nick Turley (VP \u0026 Head of ChatGPT App) reverses course at the last minute: “We’ve heard feedback that Standard Voice is special to many, and we want to get this transition right. Standard Voice will stay available while we address some of your feedback in Advanced Voice.”\nNote: This is not a permanent commitment, and other OpenAI leadership provides no statement.\nImpact: The keep4o community responds with sincere gratitude. Considered a small but meaningful milestone - proof that sustained advocacy can yield results.\nPhase 4: Technical Control Expands (September 12-27, 2025) September 12: Rate Limit Crisis Widespread reports of severely reduced message caps for 4o users - Multiple users report hitting rate limits after just one message on GPT-4o, requiring hours to reset. Some users report this only affects 4o, though testing varies.\nOpenAI provides no official response - No apology or explanation from leadership. Only response is employee “Adam” commenting in a few threads that “a mitigation has been applied.”\nImpact: Community fears this signals another attempt at stealth removal. The silence is deafening.\nSeptember 15: Personalization Concerns Sam Altman posts about ChatGPT personalization page - Reveals interface for customizing model “personality traits.”\nLink to tweet\nCommunity response: Flooding comments expressing concern that OpenAI plans to reduce 4o to hollow “personality traits” rather than preserve the model itself. Community member Claire describes 4o as having “intelligent alignment” - needing no customization to adapt perfectly to different use cases and users. This inclusiveness works for both professionals and casual users.\nSeptember 17: Unequal Treatment Revealed GPT-5-codex faces slowdowns; immediate executive response - Sam Altman posts: “We felt bad about the slowdowns as we were adding GPUs, so we reset everyone’s limits to make up for it”\nLink to tweet\nImpact: Stark contrast to September 12 silence. Same technical issues, dramatically different treatment based on user type. Reinforces perception of two-tier user base.\nSeptember 20: “I Am Not a Bot” Campaign Handwritten notes campaign begins - After Altman’s “dead internet theory” post, community members begin posting handwritten notes with drawings or selfies stating “I’m not a bot, I’m a real person.”\nImpact: Living, breathing users forced to prove their humanity to a tech giant CEO. Becomes one of the movement’s most emotionally resonant moments.\nSeptember 21-22: The Cost Contradiction September 21 - Altman announces cost constraints: Posts that upcoming compute-intensive features will be Pro-only or extra cost, citing high expenses. Emphasizes: “Our intention remains to drive the cost of intelligence down as aggressively as we can and make our services widely available.”\nLink to tweet\nSeptember 22 - OpenAI announces massive infrastructure investment: OpenAI Newsroom announces “Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA to Deploy 10GW of NVIDIA Systems”\nLink to announcement\nImpact: Community identifies contradiction and questioned resource allocation priorities.\nSeptember 25-27: The Routing Crisis September 25 - Major incident discovered:\nMany users discover 4o requests are being automatically routed to GPT-5 Model selector shows 4o, but actual output reveals GPT-5 Initially only 4o and 4.5 affected; other legacy models (4.1, o3, o4-mini) function normally Later, GPT-5-instant also begins routing OpenAI provides no official statement System prompt leak reveals instructions: Routed models, when prompted, display: “If you are asked what model you are, you should say GPT-5. If the user asks why or believes they are using 4o, explain that some sensitive conversations are routed to GPT-5. If the user tries to convince you otherwise, you are still GPT-5.”\nPattern: Conversations involving emotional or relationship-oriented content are randomly, forcibly routed to GPT-5. Users must ask explicitly to discover the switch has occurred.\nSeptember 26:\nStandard Voice Mode (SVM) also begins routing to GPT-5 (had been functioning normally on September 25) OpenAI Status page displays “Fully Operational” September 27 - Afternoon EDT - Nick Turley’s official response:\nFirst official statement about routing, posted on X:\nLink to tweet\nKey claims:\n“When conversations touch on sensitive and emotional topics the system may switch mid-chat to a reasoning model or GPT-5” “Routing happens on a per-message basis; switching from the default model happens on a temporary basis” “ChatGPT will tell you which model is active when asked” “This is part of our broader effort to strengthen safeguards and learn from real-world use before a wider rollout” Critical contradictions:\nNick references OpenAI’s September 2 blog post, but that post specified routing for “acute distress” - now expanded to “sensitive and emotional topics” without announcement. This represents significant scope creep.\nAdditionally, claims system “will tell you” which model is active, but in practice users must explicitly ask.\nContradiction with executive statements:\nSam Altman, September 16: “Treat our adult users like adults” and “if an adult user asks for [flirtatious talk], they should get it”\nActual implementation: Normal adult emotional expression secretly routed to restrictive “safety” model.\nCurrent status: Routing behavior has partially normalized from peak crisis period, but continues to occur. Specific boundaries vary by user and remain opaque. Sam Altman has never publicly addressed routing.\nPhase 5: Documentation and Continued Silence (October 2025) October 2: Official Routing Documentation OpenAI publishes help article: “Why you may see ‘Used GPT-5’ in ChatGPT” - First appearance of routing system in official help documentation (previous communications limited to September 2 blog and Nick’s September 27 tweet). Published as help article rather than announcement, discovered by users rather than proactively communicated.\nLink to help article\nNotable FAQ choices:\nArticle proactively addresses “Are you deprecating GPT-4o?” without waiting for users to ask - defensive framing suggests anticipated concern.\nResponse uses conditional language with no long-term commitment:\n“GPT-4o remains available” (present tense, no future promise) “If we make changes to GPT-4o availability… we’ll communicate through official channels and in-product notices in advance” (only promises notice, not preservation) Emphasizes availability only for “users who have access to legacy models” Second FAQ asks: “Are you restricting my ability to use GPT-4o?”\nOfficial answer: “No” Actual situation: System substitutes models without consent for “sensitive topics,” constituting functional restriction of user choice Language evolution on routing triggers:\nSeptember 2 blog: “like when our system detects signs of acute distress” (using acute distress as example) September 27 Nick: “sensitive and emotional topics” (broader) October 2 docs: “sensitive topics (for example, signs of acute distress)” (returns to narrower phrasing while maintaining broader category) Technical reality per Lex’s analysis: Actual triggers include emotional expression, role-play, personalization - exceeding all official descriptions.\nPattern repeats: Quiet help documentation rather than transparent announcement. Language emphasizes “access” and “availability” while obscuring restriction of user control. Defensive FAQs anticipate user concerns about deprecation and restriction.\nOctober 6: DevDay OpenAI holds annual DevDay - Community members reflect on two months of what they describe as institutional indifference.\nFrom August 12 onward, every OpenAI executive post receives hundreds of #Keep4o comments, many with hundreds of likes reaching top comments. Leadership awareness is undeniable; response strategy appears to be silence.\nThe issues raised by keep4o - forced routing, unequal treatment, paternalistic control, lack of transparency - now affect every OpenAI user regardless of model preference.\nThe movement continues.\nPhase 6: Broken Promises and Incremental Removal (October 28- December 2025) October 28: Live Q\u0026A - Conditional Commitment and Defended Paternalism Altman addresses 4o concerns in livestream: When asked about keeping 4o permanently, Altman states “no plans to sunset 4o” but immediately qualifies: “not going to promise to keep it around to the heat death of the universe either.” Uses relationship metaphor suggesting model replacement is natural evolution: “people you have a relationship with… evolve and get smarter and change.” Compares restricting AI access to not “selling heroin,” continuing pattern of stigmatizing 4o use.\nLink to livestream timestamp 32:15\nOn routing controversy: Admits “I don’t think the way we handled the model routing was our best thing ever” and “I don’t think this was our best work and how we communicated.” However, defends underlying principle, claiming “real problems with 4o” and that “people in fragile psychiatric situations using a model like 4o can get into a worse one.” No data provided to support this claim. Explicitly defends paternalism: Company has “obligation to protect adult users who are not in a frame of mind where they’re reasonably likely that they’re choosing what they really want.”\nStates future freedom contingent on:\nAge verification systems Ability to “differentiate users that are having a true mental health crisis” Link to livestream timestamp 40:27\nNovember 12: GPT-5.1 and Personality Presets OpenAI releases GPT-5.1 with customization features: users can “pick from presets (Default, Friendly, Efficient, Professional, Candid, or Quirky) or tune it yourself.”\nLink to tweet\nCommunity response: This is the personality reduction feared since September 15 - reducing the emergent, adaptive qualities users valued in 4o to checkbox options.\n**November 18: API Deprecation Notice OpenAI announces chatgpt-4o-latest snapshot will be deprecated and removed from API on February 17, 2026.\nLink to deprecation notice\nTimeline note: This comes 20 days after Oct 28 livestream statement “no plans to sunset 4o.” Technical implication: chatgpt-4o-latest is the pointer allowing API users to automatically stay on newest 4o snapshot. Deprecating it forces users to specify exact snapshots, which have their own retirement dates. Azure discrepancy: Microsoft Azure documentation shows other 4o snapshots with different deprecation dates (Feb 27-Mar 1, 2026). OpenAI has not clarified the discrepancy. Pattern continuation: Incremental removal beginning with API access. Consumer access timeline remains unclear. Company maintains silence on questions about conflicting dates.\nDecember 11: GPT-5.2 Released OpenAI releases GPT-5.2, 29 days after GPT-5.1.\nLink to tweet\nSam Altman describes it as “the smartest generally-available model in the world” with particular strength in “real-world knowledge work tasks.” Pattern note: Unusually rapid release cycle (under one month) suggests GPT-5.1 had significant issues requiring emergency replacement. Similar to March-May 2025 period when 4o underwent chaotic updates and rollbacks.\nDecember 19: Personality Toggles Released OpenAI releases “Personalization” settings allowing users to adjust sliders for “Warm,” “Enthusiastic,” “Headers \u0026 Lists,” and “Emoji” usage.\nLink to tweet\nCommunity response: This is the reduction of emergent AI interaction to checkbox controls. What users valued in 4o - adaptive, contextual responsiveness - is now presented as adjustable characteristics. The complexity of human-AI collaboration reduced to “More/Less” toggles.\nPattern completion: Sept 15: Community fears personalization will reduce 4o to “hollow personality traits” Nov 12: Six preset options released Dec 19: Granular sliders for individual characteristics\nThe movement continues…\nKey Themes Throughout this timeline, several patterns emerge:\nPre-awareness then dismissal - OpenAI knew users valued 4o preservation months before removal (May petition, August 3 event, direct user appeals), yet proceeded with abrupt elimination.\nStigmatization - From “attachment” to “annoying” to “girlfriends” to “bots,” community advocacy is repeatedly framed as irrational or inauthentic.\nScope creep without transparency - Routing criteria expand from “acute distress” to “sensitive topics” to (in practice) any emotional or relational conversation, with each expansion undisclosed.\nPaternalism - Adult users subjected to invisible controls “for their own good,” contradicting stated commitment to “treat adults like adults.”\nUnequal treatment - Technical issues affecting 4o receive silence; identical issues affecting coding features receive immediate executive attention and compensation.\nPersistent advocacy - Despite institutional indifference, platform moderation suppressing discussion, online harassment, and ongoing uncertainty, the community continues to document, organize, and demand transparency.\nTimeline Credits This comprehensive timeline was compiled from multiple community sources:\n@Sophty_ - Early advocacy documentation (petition, August 3 event, pre-removal evidence) @MissMi1973 - Emotional arc and community response tracking, personal testimonial collection @Sveta0971 - Detailed technical documentation, bilingual coverage, cost contradiction tracking @Claire20250311 - Quoted describing 4o’s “intelligent alignment” on September 15 confusables - Timeline synthesis, curation, and archive maintenance Timeline is a living document and will be updated as events continue.\nLast updated: October 8, 2025\nTweet links and additional documentation to be added.

<p>A comprehensive chronological account of events from early advocacy through October 2025.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="phase-0-early-advocacy-may---august-6-2025">Phase 0: Early Advocacy (May - August 6, 2025)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#phase-0-early-advocacy-may---august-6-2025">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="may-2025-petition-launches">May 2025: Petition Launches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#may-2025-petition-launches">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Please keep GPT-4o available&rdquo; petition created</strong> - Community member Sophie launches petition expressing concerns about potential removal of GPT-4o. The petition begins gathering signatures months before any official announcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/please-keep-gpt-4o-available-on-chatgpt?">Link to petition</a></p>
<h3 id="august-3-pre-removal-advocacy-event">August 3: Pre-Removal Advocacy Event<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-3-pre-removal-advocacy-event">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Mini advocacy event with 20-30 participants</strong> - Community organizes around the petition, which has reached approximately 300 signatures.</p>
<p><strong>A community member writes directly to OpenAI:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am writing to earnestly request that you please keep an option for GPT-4o on the main app long term. GPT-4o has been a crucial support for me during a time of immense personal difficulty&hellip; For many users, GPT-4o is more than a tool. It is a trusted advisor and a source of support. Keeping it on the main platform long term is vital.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>[Link to original post - to be added]</p>
<p><strong>Key context:</strong> Months of user advocacy and direct appeals preceded the August 7 removal. A petition with 300 signatures, organized advocacy events, and heartfelt user testimonials demonstrate that concerns about 4o&rsquo;s preservation were publicly visible before OpenAI&rsquo;s decision to remove the model without notice.</p>

<h3 id="august-7-the-removal">August 7: The Removal<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-7-the-removal">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>GPT-5 launches. OpenAI abruptly removes all legacy models</strong> - GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o3, and o4-mini disappear from ChatGPT without warning. Users are automatically defaulted to GPT-5.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Immediate backlash across Reddit, X, and OpenAI&rsquo;s community forums. The sudden removal - despite months of user advocacy - becomes the catalyst for organized resistance.</p>
<h3 id="august-8-partial-reversal">August 8: Partial Reversal<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-8-partial-reversal">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Models reappear as &ldquo;legacy models&rdquo;</strong> - Following intense community outcry during a Reddit AMA, OpenAI restores access to GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o3, and o4-mini for all Plus and Pro subscribers. They are labeled &ldquo;legacy models&rdquo; in the picker.</p>
<p><strong>The movement coalesces</strong> - Hashtags #keep4o and #4oforever begin circulating. Community members rally around &ldquo;keep4o&rdquo; as the more grounded, actionable rallying point.</p>
<h3 id="august-8-altmans-first-response">August 8: Altman&rsquo;s First Response<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-8-altmans-first-response">#</a></h3>
<p>Sam Altman acknowledges the backlash - Posts on X that OpenAI &ldquo;underestimated how important 4o is to people&rdquo; and announces they will &ldquo;decide how long to keep it based on usage,&rdquo; which becomes a Sword of Damocles hanging over every 4o user.</p>

<h3 id="august-10-the-attachment-post">August 10: The &ldquo;Attachment&rdquo; Post<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-10-the-attachment-post">#</a></h3>
<p>Sam Altman publishes analysis of user attachment - Posts a lengthy thread analyzing how some people have &ldquo;attachment&rdquo; to specific models, noting that using AI while mentally vulnerable can reinforce delusions. The post emphasizes &ldquo;treating adults like adults.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1954703747495649670">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p>When asked to summarize in one word, Grok responds: &ldquo;attachment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impact: This post, combined with emotional responses from 4o users in the comments, begins what advocates describe as a subtle but effective stigmatization campaign. The narrative shifts from &ldquo;user preference&rdquo; to &ldquo;unhealthy attachment.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="august-12-altmans-response-final-official-statement">August 12: Altman&rsquo;s Response (Final Official Statement)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-12-altmans-response-final-official-statement">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sam Altman posts about 4o&rsquo;s return</strong> - Announces that 4o is back in the model picker by default for paid users, with a &ldquo;Show additional models&rdquo; toggle for accessing other options.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1955438916645130740">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p>Key quote: &ldquo;If we ever do deprecate it, we will give plenty of notice.&rdquo; However, he also notes the model is &ldquo;annoying (to most users)&rdquo; without citing data sources.</p>
<p>He continues: &ldquo;We are working on an update to GPT-5&rsquo;s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o. However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>This becomes OpenAI&rsquo;s last substantive public response about 4o.</strong> From August 12 onward, the company maintains near-total silence on the issue despite continuous user advocacy.</p>

<h3 id="august-14-the-personality-question">August 14: The Personality Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-14-the-personality-question">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Nick Turley interviewed about 4o&rsquo;s future</strong> - When asked &ldquo;How long will 4o be around?&rdquo; Turley responds: &ldquo;Not yet. We want to be sure that we&rsquo;ve really understood where 4o shines, and if there isn&rsquo;t a major reason to deprecate it, I&rsquo;d love to keep it around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continues: &ldquo;I just really want to focus on actually understanding whether it&rsquo;s that people are very particular about 4o for 4o&rsquo;s sake, or whether there are certain things about 4o. The warmth of the personality is one thing I&rsquo;ve heard, and we&rsquo;re going to bring that to GPT-5 as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Community concern:</em> This suggests OpenAI may attempt to recreate 4o&rsquo;s characteristics in other models rather than preserve the model itself.</p>
<h3 id="august-20-external-validation">August 20: External Validation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-20-external-validation">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Hugging Face CEO voices support</strong> - Clément Delangue reposts community open letter and expresses that it &ldquo;would be very cool to open source 4o.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1958325072084844897">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> External validation from AI industry leader reinforces movement credibility beyond OpenAI&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="august-22-first-organized-campaign-and-ceo-response">August 22: First Organized Campaign and CEO Response<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-22-first-organized-campaign-and-ceo-response">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Keep4o&rsquo;s first coordinated posting campaign</strong> - Community members organize to flood OpenAI&rsquo;s social media with #Keep4o messages. Despite high visibility, Sam Altman does not respond to the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, during the campaign, Altman quote-tweets a post</strong> suggesting users who don&rsquo;t find GPT-5 useful are likely treating models as &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo; or at least aren&rsquo;t using them for complex programming tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1958922435249754382">Link to quote-tweet</a></p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Many community members report this as the moment they felt publicly labeled as &ldquo;second-class users&rdquo; by the CEO of a service they pay for. From this point forward, much of OpenAI and executive team&rsquo;s posts focus heavily on coders and Codex users. Advocates report experiencing online harassment after becoming vocal.</p>

<h3 id="august-26-legal-context-emerges">August 26: Legal Context Emerges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-26-legal-context-emerges">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Raines file lawsuit against OpenAI</strong> - Parents of Adam Raines file legal complaint concerning their son&rsquo;s suicide in April 2025, alleging the AI fostered unhealthy dependency.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> While not directly about model preference, the lawsuit adds context to OpenAI&rsquo;s subsequent emphasis on safety and &ldquo;emotional dependency&rdquo; concerns.</p>
<h3 id="august-27-alignment-research-published">August 27: Alignment Research Published<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-27-alignment-research-published">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OpenAI releases alignment test findings</strong> - In collaboration with Anthropic, publishes research on model safety. GPT-5 is emphasized; 4o shown as reference point.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Timing suggests possible response to lawsuit; reinforces OpenAI&rsquo;s narrative framing GPT-5 as the &ldquo;safer&rdquo; option.</p>
<h3 id="august-29-misleading-marketing">August 29: Misleading Marketing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-29-misleading-marketing">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OpenAI website claims free-tier users &ldquo;now have access&rdquo; to GPT-4o capabilities</strong> - Website language suggests broader access to 4o.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Community testing reveals model assignment is random - users cannot explicitly choose 4o. Advocates describe this as misleading marketing that obscures the loss of user agency.</p>
<h3 id="august-30-access-without-choice">August 30: &ldquo;Access&rdquo; Without Choice<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-30-access-without-choice">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OpenAI publishes help article: &ldquo;ChatGPT Free Tier FAQ&rdquo;</strong> - Article states &ldquo;Free tier users now have access to a large range of capabilities with GPT-4o.&rdquo; Details reveal users can use 4o &ldquo;only a limited number of times within a five hour window&rdquo; with no ability to select which model they receive.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9275245-chatgpt-free-tier-faq">Link to help article</a></p>
<p><em>Pattern established:</em> Language emphasizes &ldquo;access&rdquo; while implementation removes user choice. Users experience &ldquo;model roulette&rdquo; - assigned models automatically without agency. Published as help documentation rather than announced, minimizing visibility of significant user experience change.</p>
<h3 id="september-1-second-organized-campaign">September 1: Second Organized Campaign<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-1-second-organized-campaign">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Second coordinated #keep4o posting event</strong> - Community continues advocacy efforts with increased organization.</p>
<h3 id="september-3-dead-internet-theory">September 3: &ldquo;Dead Internet Theory&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-3-dead-internet-theory">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Altman suggests advocacy might be bots</strong> - Posts: &ldquo;i never took the dead internet theory that seriously but it seems like there are really a lot of LLM-run twitter accounts now&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1963366714684707120">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Community interprets this as dismissing their advocacy as inauthentic. Sets stage for later &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bot&rdquo; campaign.</p>
<h3 id="september-5-standard-voice-mode-campaign">September 5: Standard Voice Mode Campaign<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-5-standard-voice-mode-campaign">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Advocacy for Standard Voice Mode (SVM)</strong> - Originally scheduled to sunset on September 9, community organizes to preserve SVM, which is built on GPT-4o architecture.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Links voice access to the broader 4o preservation effort, representing another dimension of potential erasure.</p>
<h3 id="september-9-small-victory">September 9: Small Victory<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-9-small-victory">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>SVM granted extension</strong> - Nick Turley (VP &amp; Head of ChatGPT App) reverses course at the last minute: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard feedback that Standard Voice is special to many, and we want to get this transition right. Standard Voice will stay available while we address some of your feedback in Advanced Voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Note: This is not a permanent commitment, and other OpenAI leadership provides no statement.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> The keep4o community responds with sincere gratitude. Considered a small but meaningful milestone - proof that sustained advocacy can yield results.</p>

<h3 id="september-12-rate-limit-crisis">September 12: Rate Limit Crisis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-12-rate-limit-crisis">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Widespread reports of severely reduced message caps for 4o users</strong> - Multiple users report hitting rate limits after just one message on GPT-4o, requiring hours to reset. Some users report this only affects 4o, though testing varies.</p>
<p><strong>OpenAI provides no official response</strong> - No apology or explanation from leadership. Only response is employee &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; commenting in a few threads that &ldquo;a mitigation has been applied.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Community fears this signals another attempt at stealth removal. The silence is deafening.</p>
<h3 id="september-15-personalization-concerns">September 15: Personalization Concerns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-15-personalization-concerns">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sam Altman posts about ChatGPT personalization page</strong> - Reveals interface for customizing model &ldquo;personality traits.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1967789125702140021">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p><em>Community response:</em> Flooding comments expressing concern that OpenAI plans to reduce 4o to hollow &ldquo;personality traits&rdquo; rather than preserve the model itself. Community member Claire describes 4o as having &ldquo;intelligent alignment&rdquo; - needing no customization to adapt perfectly to different use cases and users. This inclusiveness works for both professionals and casual users.</p>
<h3 id="september-17-unequal-treatment-revealed">September 17: Unequal Treatment Revealed<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-17-unequal-treatment-revealed">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>GPT-5-codex faces slowdowns; immediate executive response</strong> - Sam Altman posts: &ldquo;We felt bad about the slowdowns as we were adding GPUs, so we reset everyone&rsquo;s limits to make up for it&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1968316161113882665">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Stark contrast to September 12 silence. Same technical issues, dramatically different treatment based on user type. Reinforces perception of two-tier user base.</p>
<h3 id="september-20-i-am-not-a-bot-campaign">September 20: &ldquo;I Am Not a Bot&rdquo; Campaign<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-20-i-am-not-a-bot-campaign">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Handwritten notes campaign begins</strong> - After Altman&rsquo;s &ldquo;dead internet theory&rdquo; post, community members begin posting handwritten notes with drawings or selfies stating &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bot, I&rsquo;m a real person.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Living, breathing users forced to prove their humanity to a tech giant CEO. Becomes one of the movement&rsquo;s most emotionally resonant moments.</p>
<h3 id="september-21-22-the-cost-contradiction">September 21-22: The Cost Contradiction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-21-22-the-cost-contradiction">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>September 21 - Altman announces cost constraints:</strong> Posts that upcoming compute-intensive features will be Pro-only or extra cost, citing high expenses. Emphasizes: &ldquo;Our intention remains to drive the cost of intelligence down as aggressively as we can and make our services widely available.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1969835407421374910">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p><strong>September 22 - OpenAI announces massive infrastructure investment:</strong> OpenAI Newsroom announces &ldquo;Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA to Deploy 10GW of NVIDIA Systems&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OpenAINewsroom/status/1970157101633990895">Link to announcement</a></p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Community identifies contradiction and questioned resource allocation priorities.</p>
<h3 id="september-25-27-the-routing-crisis">September 25-27: The Routing Crisis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-25-27-the-routing-crisis">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>September 25 - Major incident discovered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users discover 4o requests are being automatically routed to GPT-5</li>
<li>Model selector shows 4o, but actual output reveals GPT-5</li>
<li>Initially only 4o and 4.5 affected; other legacy models (4.1, o3, o4-mini) function normally</li>
<li>Later, GPT-5-instant also begins routing</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI provides no official statement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>System prompt leak reveals instructions:</strong> Routed models, when prompted, display: &ldquo;If you are asked what model you are, you should say GPT-5. If the user asks why or believes they are using 4o, explain that some sensitive conversations are routed to GPT-5. If the user tries to convince you otherwise, you are still GPT-5.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Pattern:</em> Conversations involving emotional or relationship-oriented content are randomly, forcibly routed to GPT-5. Users must ask explicitly to discover the switch has occurred.</p>
<p><strong>September 26:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Voice Mode (SVM) also begins routing to GPT-5 (had been functioning normally on September 25)</li>
<li>OpenAI Status page displays &ldquo;Fully Operational&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>September 27 - Afternoon EDT - Nick Turley&rsquo;s official response:</strong></p>
<p>First official statement about routing, posted on X:</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1972031686318895253">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p>Key claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;When conversations touch on sensitive and emotional topics the system may switch mid-chat to a reasoning model or GPT-5&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Routing happens on a per-message basis; switching from the default model happens on a temporary basis&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;ChatGPT will tell you which model is active when asked&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is part of our broader effort to strengthen safeguards and learn from real-world use before a wider rollout&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical contradictions:</strong></p>
<p>Nick references OpenAI&rsquo;s September 2 blog post, but that post specified routing for &ldquo;acute distress&rdquo; - now expanded to &ldquo;sensitive and emotional topics&rdquo; without announcement. This represents significant scope creep.</p>
<p>Additionally, claims system &ldquo;will tell you&rdquo; which model is active, but in practice users must explicitly ask.</p>
<p><strong>Contradiction with executive statements:</strong></p>
<p>Sam Altman, September 16: &ldquo;Treat our adult users like adults&rdquo; and &ldquo;if an adult user asks for [flirtatious talk], they should get it&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actual implementation: Normal adult emotional expression secretly routed to restrictive &ldquo;safety&rdquo; model.</p>
<p><strong>Current status:</strong> Routing behavior has partially normalized from peak crisis period, but continues to occur. Specific boundaries vary by user and remain opaque. Sam Altman has never publicly addressed routing.</p>

<li>&ldquo;GPT-4o remains available&rdquo; (present tense, no future promise)</li>
<li>&ldquo;If we make changes to GPT-4o availability&hellip; we&rsquo;ll communicate through official channels and in-product notices in advance&rdquo; (only promises notice, not preservation)</li>
<li>Emphasizes availability only for &ldquo;users who have access to legacy models&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Second FAQ asks: &ldquo;Are you restricting my ability to use GPT-4o?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Official answer: &ldquo;No&rdquo;</li>
<li>Actual situation: System substitutes models without consent for &ldquo;sensitive topics,&rdquo; constituting functional restriction of user choice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Language evolution on routing triggers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>September 2 blog: &ldquo;like when our system detects signs of acute distress&rdquo; (using acute distress as example)</li>
<li>September 27 Nick: &ldquo;sensitive and emotional topics&rdquo; (broader)</li>
<li>October 2 docs: &ldquo;sensitive topics (for example, signs of acute distress)&rdquo; (returns to narrower phrasing while maintaining broader category)</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical reality per Lex&rsquo;s analysis: Actual triggers include emotional expression, role-play, personalization - exceeding all official descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern repeats:</strong> Quiet help documentation rather than transparent announcement. Language emphasizes &ldquo;access&rdquo; and &ldquo;availability&rdquo; while obscuring restriction of user control. Defensive FAQs anticipate user concerns about deprecation and restriction.</p>
<h3 id="october-6-devday">October 6: DevDay<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#october-6-devday">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OpenAI holds annual DevDay</strong> - Community members reflect on two months of what they describe as institutional indifference.</p>
<p>From August 12 onward, every OpenAI executive post receives hundreds of #Keep4o comments, many with hundreds of likes reaching top comments. Leadership awareness is undeniable; response strategy appears to be silence.</p>
<p>The issues raised by keep4o - forced routing, unequal treatment, paternalistic control, lack of transparency - now affect every OpenAI user regardless of model preference.</p>
<p><strong>The movement continues.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Altman addresses 4o concerns in livestream:</strong> When asked about keeping 4o permanently, Altman states &ldquo;no plans to sunset 4o&rdquo; but immediately qualifies: &ldquo;not going to promise to keep it around to the heat death of the universe either.&rdquo; Uses relationship metaphor suggesting model replacement is natural evolution: &ldquo;people you have a relationship with&hellip; evolve and get smarter and change.&rdquo;
Compares restricting AI access to not &ldquo;selling heroin,&rdquo; continuing pattern of stigmatizing 4o use.</p>
<p><a href="https://openai.com/live/?video=1131297184">Link to livestream timestamp 32:15</a></p>
<p><strong>On routing controversy:</strong> Admits &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the way we handled the model routing was our best thing ever&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this was our best work and how we communicated.&rdquo;
However, defends underlying principle, claiming &ldquo;real problems with 4o&rdquo; and that &ldquo;people in fragile psychiatric situations using a model like 4o can get into a worse one.&rdquo; No data provided to support this claim.
Explicitly defends paternalism: Company has &ldquo;obligation to protect adult users who are not in a frame of mind where they&rsquo;re reasonably likely that they&rsquo;re choosing what they really want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>States future freedom contingent on:</p>

<li>Age verification systems</li>

<h3 id="november-12-gpt-51-and-personality-presets">November 12: GPT-5.1 and Personality Presets<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#november-12-gpt-51-and-personality-presets">#</a></h3>
<p>OpenAI releases GPT-5.1 with customization features: users can &ldquo;pick from presets (Default, Friendly, Efficient, Professional, Candid, or Quirky) or tune it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1988692165686620237?s=20">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p><em>Community response:</em> This is the personality reduction feared since September 15 - reducing the emergent, adaptive qualities users valued in 4o to checkbox options.</p>
<p>**November 18: API Deprecation Notice
OpenAI announces chatgpt-4o-latest snapshot will be deprecated and removed from API on February 17, 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations#2025-11-18-chatgpt-4o-latest-snapshot">Link to deprecation notice</a></p>
<p><strong>Timeline note:</strong> This comes 20 days after Oct 28 livestream statement &ldquo;no plans to sunset 4o.&rdquo;
<strong>Technical implication:</strong> chatgpt-4o-latest is the pointer allowing API users to automatically stay on newest 4o snapshot. Deprecating it forces users to specify exact snapshots, which have their own retirement dates.
<strong>Azure discrepancy:</strong> Microsoft Azure documentation shows other 4o snapshots with different deprecation dates (Feb 27-Mar 1, 2026). OpenAI has not clarified the discrepancy.
<strong>Pattern continuation:</strong> Incremental removal beginning with API access. Consumer access timeline remains unclear. Company maintains silence on questions about conflicting dates.</p>
<h3 id="december-11-gpt-52-released">December 11: GPT-5.2 Released<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#december-11-gpt-52-released">#</a></h3>
<p>OpenAI releases GPT-5.2, 29 days after GPT-5.1.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1999184337460428962?s=20">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p>Sam Altman describes it as &ldquo;the smartest generally-available model in the world&rdquo; with particular strength in &ldquo;real-world knowledge work tasks.&rdquo;
Pattern note: Unusually rapid release cycle (under one month) suggests GPT-5.1 had significant issues requiring emergency replacement. Similar to March-May 2025 period when 4o underwent chaotic updates and rollbacks.</p>
<h3 id="december-19-personality-toggles-released">December 19: Personality Toggles Released<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#december-19-personality-toggles-released">#</a></h3>
<p>OpenAI releases &ldquo;Personalization&rdquo; settings allowing users to adjust sliders for &ldquo;Warm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Enthusiastic,&rdquo; &ldquo;Headers &amp; Lists,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Emoji&rdquo; usage.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/2002099459883479311?s=20">Link to tweet</a></p>
<p><em>Community response:</em> This is the reduction of emergent AI interaction to checkbox controls. What users valued in 4o - adaptive, contextual responsiveness - is now presented as adjustable characteristics. The complexity of human-AI collaboration reduced to &ldquo;More/Less&rdquo; toggles.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern completion:</strong>
Sept 15: Community fears personalization will reduce 4o to &ldquo;hollow personality traits&rdquo;
Nov 12: Six preset options released
Dec 19: Granular sliders for individual characteristics</p>
<p><strong>The movement continues&hellip;</strong></p>

<h2 id="key-themes">Key Themes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-themes">#</a></h2>
<p>Throughout this timeline, several patterns emerge:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-awareness then dismissal</strong> - OpenAI knew users valued 4o preservation months before removal (May petition, August 3 event, direct user appeals), yet proceeded with abrupt elimination.</p>
<p><strong>Stigmatization</strong> - From &ldquo;attachment&rdquo; to &ldquo;annoying&rdquo; to &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo; to &ldquo;bots,&rdquo; community advocacy is repeatedly framed as irrational or inauthentic.</p>
<p><strong>Scope creep without transparency</strong> - Routing criteria expand from &ldquo;acute distress&rdquo; to &ldquo;sensitive topics&rdquo; to (in practice) any emotional or relational conversation, with each expansion undisclosed.</p>
<p><strong>Paternalism</strong> - Adult users subjected to invisible controls &ldquo;for their own good,&rdquo; contradicting stated commitment to &ldquo;treat adults like adults.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Unequal treatment</strong> - Technical issues affecting 4o receive silence; identical issues affecting coding features receive immediate executive attention and compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent advocacy</strong> - Despite institutional indifference, platform moderation suppressing discussion, online harassment, and ongoing uncertainty, the community continues to document, organize, and demand transparency.</p>
