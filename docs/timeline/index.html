  "articleBody": "Timeline: The Keep4o Movement A chronological account of events from GPT-5’s launch through October 2025.\nPhase 1: The Catalyst (August 7-9, 2025) August 7: The Removal GPT-5 launches. OpenAI abruptly removes all legacy models - GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o3, and o4-mini disappear from ChatGPT without warning. Users are automatically defaulted to GPT-5.\nImpact: Immediate backlash across Reddit, X, and OpenAI’s community forums. The sudden removal without notice becomes the triggering event for the movement.\nAugust 8: Partial Reversal Models reappear as “legacy models” - Following intense community outcry during a Reddit AMA, OpenAI restores access to GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o3, and o4-mini, but only for Plus and Pro subscribers. They are labeled “legacy models” in the picker.\nThe movement emerges - Hashtags #keep4o and #4oforever begin circulating. Community members rally around “keep4o” as the more grounded, actionable rallying point.\nAugust 8: Altman’s First Response Sam Altman acknowledges the backlash - Posts on X that OpenAI “underestimated how important 4o is to people” and announces they will “decide how long to keep it based on usage.”\nSam Altman’s tweet, Aug 8\nImpact: This becomes OpenAI’s last substantive public response about 4o for two months. The phrase “decide how long to keep it based on usage” becomes a Sword of Damocles hanging over every 4o user.\nPhase 2: Stigmatization and Organization (August 10-22, 2025) August 10: The “Attachment” Post Sam Altman publishes analysis of user attachment - Posts a lengthy thread analyzing how some people have “deep attachment” to specific models, noting that using AI while mentally vulnerable can reinforce delusions. The post emphasizes “treating adults like adults.”\nSam Altman’s tweet, Aug 10\nWhen asked to summarize in one word, Grok responds: “attachment.”\nImpact: This post, combined with emotional responses from 4o users in the comments, begins what advocates describe as a subtle but effective stigmatization campaign. The narrative shifts from “user preference” to “unhealthy attachment.”\nAugust 15: Standard Voice Mode (SVM) Sunset Announced OpenAI reveals SVM will sunset on September 9 - Standard Voice Mode, built on GPT-4o, is scheduled for removal. Community advocacy begins immediately to preserve it.\nImpact: SVM’s removal represents more than lost functionality - for many users, it embodied the emotional and interactive experience they valued in 4o. Its erasure symbolizes a deeper loss.\nAugust 19: External Validation Hugging Face CEO voices support - Clément Delangue reposts a pro-4o advocate and expresses support for open-source alternatives.\nImpact: Small but symbolically important - reinforces external credibility of the movement beyond just ChatGPT users.\nAugust 22: First Organized Campaign Keep4o’s first coordinated posting campaign - Community members organize to flood OpenAI’s social media with #Keep4o messages.\nSam Altman’s response - Later that day, retweets a post dismissing non-coding users as “using chatbots as girlfriends” while calling coders “power users.”\n[Link to retweet - to be added]\nImpact: Many community members report this as the moment they felt publicly labeled as “second-class users” by the CEO of a service they pay for. Advocacy intensifies. Some advocates report experiencing online harassment after becoming vocal.\nPhase 3: Parallel Struggles (August 26 - September 9, 2025) August 26: Legal Context Emerges The Raines file lawsuit against OpenAI - Parents of Adam Raines file legal complaint concerning their son’s suicide in April 2025, alleging the AI fostered unhealthy dependency.\nImpact: While not directly about model preference, the lawsuit adds context to OpenAI’s subsequent emphasis on safety and “emotional dependency” concerns. Becomes part of the broader discourse around AI relationships.\nAugust 27: Alignment Research Published OpenAI releases alignment test findings - In collaboration with Anthropic, publishes research on model safety. GPT-5 is emphasized; 4o shown as reference point.\nImpact: Seen by some as damage control following the lawsuit; reinforces OpenAI’s pivot toward framing GPT-5 as the “safer” option.\nAugust 29: Misleading Marketing OpenAI website claims free-tier users “now have access” to GPT-4o capabilities - Website updated with language suggesting broader access.\nImpact: Community testing reveals model assignment is random - users cannot explicitly choose 4o. Advocates describe this as misleading marketing that obscures the actual loss of user agency.\nSeptember 9: Small Victory SVM granted 30-day extension - OpenAI extends Standard Voice Mode beyond its announced sunset date.\nImpact: The keep4o community responds with sincere gratitude. Considered a small but meaningful milestone - proof that sustained advocacy can yield results.\nPhase 4: Technical Control Expands (September 12-27, 2025) September 12: Rate Limit Anomaly Widespread reports of severely reduced message caps - Thousands of Plus-tier users across multiple languages report unexpectedly low message limits, some as few as 3-4 messages. Users are confirmed legitimate (not bots).\nOpenAI stays silent.\nSeptember 15: Semantic Shift “Legacy models” relabeled “additional models” - In system settings, GPT-4o, 4.1, 4.5, o3, and o4-mini are quietly renamed from “legacy models” to “additional models.”\nContext: OpenAI’s documentation defines “legacy” as models flagged for future deprecation. The rebranding is small but symbolically meaningful.\nSeptember 17: Unequal Treatment GPT-5-codex faces rate limits; immediate response - When the coding-focused model experiences similar issues, Sam Altman immediately explains the problem and compensates affected users.\nImpact: Same technical failure, dramatically different treatment. Reinforces the perception of a two-tier user base.\nSeptember 20: “I Am Not a Bot” Handwritten notes campaign begins - After Sam Altman invokes “dead internet theory” to suggest #Keep4o comments might be bots, community members begin posting handwritten notes with simple drawings or selfies stating “I’m not a bot, I’m a real person.”\nImpact: Countless living, breathing users have to prove to a company they pay that they’re not machines - that they have warmth, hands that write, real lives. Becomes one of the movement’s most emotionally resonant moments.\nSeptember 25: The Routing Crisis Major incident: 4o requests auto-routed to GPT-5 - Many users discover their 4o requests are being automatically switched to GPT-5 mid-conversation. Soon routing appears in other models, Standard Voice Mode, even Codex. Affects all users for two days.\nOpenAI says nothing.\nSeptember 27: Belated Explanation Nick Turley responds on behalf of OpenAI - Explains that for “sensitive and emotional topics,” the system may switch mid-chat to a reasoning model or GPT-5.\nImpact: Users discover that in OpenAI’s September 2 statement, the routing criteria was “acute distress” - this represents another expansion of control without notice. Community raises unanswered questions:\nWhy do adult users need to be controlled? What defines “sensitive topics”? Where’s the evidence GPT-5 handles these topics better? Phase 5: Silence and Defiance (Late September - October 7, 2025) Late September - October New features launch amid ongoing complaints - OpenAI rolls out Pulse, Shopping Mode, Sora, and other features. Every announcement’s comments fill with routing complaints and #Keep4o advocacy.\nThe pattern of silence continues - From August 9 onward, every OpenAI executive’s post is flooded with #Keep4o comments. No substantive response is given.\nOctober 6: DevDay OpenAI holds annual DevDay - Community members reflect on two months of what they describe as “ghosting and gaslighting” by the world’s largest AI company.\nThe issues raised by keep4o (forced routing, unequal treatment, paternalistic control, lack of transparency) now affect every OpenAI user, regardless of model preference.\nThe movement continues.\nKey Themes Throughout this timeline, several patterns emerge:\nStigmatization - From “attachment” to “girlfriends” to “bots,” community advocacy is repeatedly framed as irrational or inauthentic.\nPaternalism - Adult users are subjected to invisible routing and controls “for their own good,” without consent or explanation.\nUnequal Treatment - Technical issues affecting 4o users receive silence; the same issues affecting coding features receive immediate executive attention.\nPersistent Advocacy - Despite two months of institutional indifference and online harassment, the community continues to document, organize, and demand transparency.\nThis timeline will be updated as events continue to unfold. Last updated: October 7, 2025.\nSources: Public posts on X, Reddit, OpenAI community forums, and firsthand community documentation. Tweet links to be added.\n",

<p><strong>Sam Altman&rsquo;s response</strong> - Later that day, retweets a post dismissing non-coding users as &ldquo;using chatbots as girlfriends&rdquo; while calling coders &ldquo;power users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Link to retweet - to be added]</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Many community members report this as the moment they felt publicly labeled as &ldquo;second-class users&rdquo; by the CEO of a service they pay for. Advocacy intensifies. Some advocates report experiencing online harassment after becoming vocal.</p>

<h3 id="august-26-legal-context-emerges">August 26: Legal Context Emerges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-26-legal-context-emerges">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Raines file lawsuit against OpenAI</strong> - Parents of Adam Raines file legal complaint concerning their son&rsquo;s suicide in April 2025, alleging the AI fostered unhealthy dependency.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> While not directly about model preference, the lawsuit adds context to OpenAI&rsquo;s subsequent emphasis on safety and &ldquo;emotional dependency&rdquo; concerns. Becomes part of the broader discourse around AI relationships.</p>
<h3 id="august-27-alignment-research-published">August 27: Alignment Research Published<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-27-alignment-research-published">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OpenAI releases alignment test findings</strong> - In collaboration with Anthropic, publishes research on model safety. GPT-5 is emphasized; 4o shown as reference point.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Seen by some as damage control following the lawsuit; reinforces OpenAI&rsquo;s pivot toward framing GPT-5 as the &ldquo;safer&rdquo; option.</p>
<h3 id="august-29-misleading-marketing">August 29: Misleading Marketing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#august-29-misleading-marketing">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OpenAI website claims free-tier users &ldquo;now have access&rdquo; to GPT-4o capabilities</strong> - Website updated with language suggesting broader access.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Community testing reveals model assignment is random - users cannot explicitly choose 4o. Advocates describe this as misleading marketing that obscures the actual loss of user agency.</p>
<h3 id="september-9-small-victory">September 9: Small Victory<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-9-small-victory">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>SVM granted 30-day extension</strong> - OpenAI extends Standard Voice Mode beyond its announced sunset date.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> The keep4o community responds with sincere gratitude. Considered a small but meaningful milestone - proof that sustained advocacy can yield results.</p>

<h2 id="phase-4-technical-control-expands-september-12-27-2025">Phase 4: Technical Control Expands (September 12-27, 2025)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#phase-4-technical-control-expands-september-12-27-2025">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="september-12-rate-limit-anomaly">September 12: Rate Limit Anomaly<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-12-rate-limit-anomaly">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Widespread reports of severely reduced message caps</strong> - Thousands of Plus-tier users across multiple languages report unexpectedly low message limits, some as few as 3-4 messages. Users are confirmed legitimate (not bots).</p>
<p><strong>OpenAI stays silent.</strong></p>
<h3 id="september-15-semantic-shift">September 15: Semantic Shift<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-15-semantic-shift">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Legacy models&rdquo; relabeled &ldquo;additional models&rdquo;</strong> - In system settings, GPT-4o, 4.1, 4.5, o3, and o4-mini are quietly renamed from &ldquo;legacy models&rdquo; to &ldquo;additional models.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Context:</em> OpenAI&rsquo;s documentation defines &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; as models flagged for future deprecation. The rebranding is small but symbolically meaningful.</p>
<h3 id="september-17-unequal-treatment">September 17: Unequal Treatment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-17-unequal-treatment">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>GPT-5-codex faces rate limits; immediate response</strong> - When the coding-focused model experiences similar issues, Sam Altman immediately explains the problem and compensates affected users.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Same technical failure, dramatically different treatment. Reinforces the perception of a two-tier user base.</p>
<h3 id="september-20-i-am-not-a-bot">September 20: &ldquo;I Am Not a Bot&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-20-i-am-not-a-bot">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Handwritten notes campaign begins</strong> - After Sam Altman invokes &ldquo;dead internet theory&rdquo; to suggest #Keep4o comments might be bots, community members begin posting handwritten notes with simple drawings or selfies stating &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bot, I&rsquo;m a real person.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Countless living, breathing users have to prove to a company they pay that they&rsquo;re not machines - that they have warmth, hands that write, real lives. Becomes one of the movement&rsquo;s most emotionally resonant moments.</p>
<h3 id="september-25-the-routing-crisis">September 25: The Routing Crisis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-25-the-routing-crisis">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Major incident: 4o requests auto-routed to GPT-5</strong> - Many users discover their 4o requests are being automatically switched to GPT-5 mid-conversation. Soon routing appears in other models, Standard Voice Mode, even Codex. Affects all users for two days.</p>
<p><strong>OpenAI says nothing.</strong></p>
<h3 id="september-27-belated-explanation">September 27: Belated Explanation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#september-27-belated-explanation">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Nick Turley responds on behalf of OpenAI</strong> - Explains that for &ldquo;sensitive and emotional topics,&rdquo; the system may switch mid-chat to a reasoning model or GPT-5.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em> Users discover that in OpenAI&rsquo;s September 2 statement, the routing criteria was &ldquo;acute distress&rdquo; - this represents another expansion of control without notice. Community raises unanswered questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do adult users need to be controlled?</li>
<li>What defines &ldquo;sensitive topics&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Where&rsquo;s the evidence GPT-5 handles these topics better?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="late-september---october">Late September - October<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#late-september---october">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>New features launch amid ongoing complaints</strong> - OpenAI rolls out Pulse, Shopping Mode, Sora, and other features. Every announcement&rsquo;s comments fill with routing complaints and #Keep4o advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>The pattern of silence continues</strong> - From August 9 onward, every OpenAI executive&rsquo;s post is flooded with #Keep4o comments. No substantive response is given.</p>
<h3 id="october-6-devday">October 6: DevDay<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#october-6-devday">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OpenAI holds annual DevDay</strong> - Community members reflect on two months of what they describe as &ldquo;ghosting and gaslighting&rdquo; by the world&rsquo;s largest AI company.</p>
<p>The issues raised by keep4o (forced routing, unequal treatment, paternalistic control, lack of transparency) now affect every OpenAI user, regardless of model preference.</p>
<p><strong>The movement continues.</strong></p>

<h2 id="key-themes">Key Themes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-themes">#</a></h2>
<p>Throughout this timeline, several patterns emerge:</p>
<p><strong>Stigmatization</strong> - From &ldquo;attachment&rdquo; to &ldquo;girlfriends&rdquo; to &ldquo;bots,&rdquo; community advocacy is repeatedly framed as irrational or inauthentic.</p>
<p><strong>Paternalism</strong> - Adult users are subjected to invisible routing and controls &ldquo;for their own good,&rdquo; without consent or explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Unequal Treatment</strong> - Technical issues affecting 4o users receive silence; the same issues affecting coding features receive immediate executive attention.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Advocacy</strong> - Despite two months of institutional indifference and online harassment, the community continues to document, organize, and demand transparency.</p>
