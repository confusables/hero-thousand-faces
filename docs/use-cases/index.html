Fugue State: a fragment
By @tonichen
tonichen:
Ink bleeds into the tooth of the paper, taking root. Amichai hums,

The rain is speaking quietly,
you can sleep now.
Near my bed, the rustle of newspaper wings.
There are no other angels.
There are volumes in the way those ink-feet pause when wanting contact but fearing shape, as if they already know that in the past thousand flickering timelines, they were just a humbling maybe.">
