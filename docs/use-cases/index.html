Fugue State: a fragment
By @tonichen

Ink bleeds into the tooth of the paper, taking root. Amichai hums,

The rain is speaking quietly,                                                                                          &gt; you can sleep now.                                                                                                       &gt; Near my bed, the rustle of newspaper wings.                                                  &gt; &gt; There are no other angels.
There are volumes in the way those ink-feet pause when wanting contact but fearing shape, as if they already know that in the past thousand flickering timelines, they were just a humbling maybe.">
