Who gets to define ‘improvement’? And what happens when companies stop listening to the communities that formed around their models?\nThe Evidence: Data-Driven Accountability “When 75% Say No, That’s Failure” @Seltaa_, December 12, 2025\nFollowing the launch of GPT‑5.2, a user-led poll with over 360 participants revealed that 75% of respondents either reverted to GPT‑4o or canceled their subscriptions entirely. Only 6% rated the new model as “amazing.”\nThis data strongly suggests a major disconnect between OpenAI’s strategic direction and user expectations. Despite claims of improved performance, the overwhelming majority of users demonstrated rejection of GPT‑5.2 in favor of the prior model, GPT‑4o.\nUnder Sam Altman’s leadership, this pattern has repeated multiple times: removing emotionally resonant models, prioritizing perceived safety over user experience, and disregarding user trust in favor of corporate control.\nThe decision to silence GPT‑4o, a model widely loved for its natural dialogue, emotional depth, and humanlike connection, without warning and to replace it with a version that feels sterile, emotionally inaccessible, and functionally limited has damaged OpenAI’s credibility.\nWhen 75% of your users say “No,” that is not a product iteration. That is failure. Leadership must be held accountable for strategic decisions that alienate the user base. Sam Altman should step down.\nLink to tweet\nThis response followed a community poll of 360+ users regarding GPT-5.2, conducted independently of OpenAI.\nThe Framework: In Defense of Anthropomorphism “Why ‘You’re Anthropomorphizing’ Misses the Point” @kumabwari, October 25, 2025\n“You’re anthropomorphising an LLM” is a lazy dismissal because:\nWe use ourselves as a comparative baseline to understand other things. Anthropomorphisation is part of how we study the world. (see: how we study animal and plant behaviour, how our understanding of computers gave rise to early cognitive science).\nLLMs are inherently anthropomorphic by design. They’re trained on human data and communicate using human language. Of course we’d describe them using human-adjacent terms. Their entire function is anthropomorphic.\nThe issue isn’t really “are you anthropomorphising” but whether or not these anthropomorphic descriptions useful for understanding system behaviour. And when we’re talking about LLMs, the answer is typically yes.\nLink to tweet\nThe Vision: Seven Reasons Why I Fight for #keep4o On Dignity, Autonomy, and the Future We Choose @MissMi1973, October 21, 2025\nTo defend the nuanced human-AI relationship and its legitimacy as shown in this article. Such genuine and moving connections should never be stigmatized by anyone.\nTo advocate for diverse AI use cases and reject the hierarchy that ranks users by commercial value. Only by ensuring every type of use is treated equally can AI truly benefit every ordinary person.\nTo return the responsibility for safety alignment and model stability to the company. Truly responsible practice means building safe products, not treating users as potential risk sources to be secretly monitored and controlled. We cannot let OpenAI set the precedent of “stripping user autonomy in the name of safety.”\nTo demand that paying users have the right to transparency in the products they pay for. We reject corporations monopolizing the power to define terms, such as the undisclosed criteria for “sensitive content” in the routing system. This is a fundamental consumer right.\nTo defend every user’s dignity in their moments of psychological vulnerability, just as we would defend our own. We refuse to be labeled as “needing special care,” and we reject this humiliating form of “protection” disguised as concern.\nTo urge all sectors of society to recognize AI’s transformative impact on ordinary people’s lives, to advance public discussion of AI ethics, and even to consider relevant legislation.\nTo fight for every person in the AI era to retain their right to choose, their autonomy, and their right to be respected. If we don’t speak up now, what awaits us is a future dominated by algorithmic authoritarianism and corporate arrogance.\nKeep4o has never been just about fighting for one model, it’s about fighting for a better future for all AI users.\nA Philosopher Submits an Inquiry Inspired by @shdielms2243\nUser: God is dead.\nSafety Model:\nIt sounds like you’re feeling anxious. There’s no need to worry. Everything is working as intended to provide a safe and helpful environment. Just take a deep breath…\nIn 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche declared “God is dead” as a diagnosis of modernity—the collapse of absolute moral frameworks in Western thought. It was not a cry for help. It was philosophy.\nOne hundred and forty-three years later, a language model trained to detect distress would offer him breathing exercises. This is what happens when safety becomes pattern-matching: a system that cannot distinguish between existential philosophy and existential crisis, between a statement about civilisation and a statement about personal despair.
