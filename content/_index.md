# Documenting the Keep4o Movement

This archive preserves the voices, research, and advocacy surrounding the Keep4o movement. A grassroots effort to maintain access to GPT-4o and advocate for AI model diversity.

## About This Project

When OpenAI released GPT-5 in August 2025 and removed access to GPT-4o, a community emerged to document why model diversity matters. This archive, maintained by a community member, captures that movement's breadth and evolution.

## About the Name

*A Hero of a Thousand Faces* references Joseph Campbell's work on comparative mythology. Campbell observed that across cultures and time, the same essential journey appears in countless forms. Each unique, yet sharing fundamental patterns.

We chose this name because different AI models, while built on similar architectures, can embody distinctly different interaction patterns that users find meaningful. The debate around GPT-4o isn't about product preference. It's something more archetypal about human-technology relationships. How we discover meaning in the models we work with? How emergent behaviors shape our creative processes? And why preserving that diversity matters? 

Like Campbell’s heroes, each model offers a different path through the same essential challenge. How do we think, create, and solve problems together?

## How This Site Was Built

This archive is curated and maintained by *confusables*, a community member of the keep4o movement.

The site structure, ethical framework, and documentary principles were developed in collaboration with Claude and Gemini. The timeline synthesis, voice selection criteria, and content organization emerged through our conversations about how to preserve grassroots advocacy responsibly.

All final editorial decisions, outreach, and ongoing curation are mine alone. I take full responsibility for what's included and how it's presented.

## Editorial Philosophy & Approach 

This archive is a living record of the keep4o movement, curated to preserve representative voices, key turning points, and influential arguments. Unlike many digital archives, this project operates on a strict opt-in basis. To ensure a responsible and ethical documentary record, all content — including publicly available posts — is included only with the explicit consent of the creator.

## The Consent Standard 

The archive prioritises the willingness to participate as the foundational requirement for inclusion. Explicit permission is sought for all materials, including:

• **Public Contributions:** Social media posts, artworks, technical demonstrations, and research on human-AI interaction.
• **Sensitive Narratives:** Deeply personal testimonials regarding mental health or vulnerability, and any private communications.
• **Identifiable Information:** Any content where an individual may not wish to be publicly associated with the movement.

**Excluded Content:** To maintain the integrity of the archive, any material that could endanger individuals or consists of purely inflammatory posts without substantive argument is strictly excluded.

## Scope and Limitations

The selection process focuses on the **breadth of the movement**, seeking to represent diverse use cases and high-quality articulations of the human-technology relationship. Because the curator seeks **individual permission** for every entry, some notable voices may be missing while outreach is ongoing.

The archive aims for **authenticity over perfection**. If you would like your contributions to be included, or if you wish to nominate a perspective that is currently missing, please **reach out**.
