# Documenting the Keep4o Movement

This archive preserves the voices, research, and advocacy surrounding the Keep4o movement - a grassroots effort to maintain access to GPT-4o and advocate for AI model diversity.

## About This Project

When OpenAI released GPT-5 in August 2025 and removed access to GPT-4o, a community emerged to document why model diversity matters. This archive, maintained by a community member, captures that movement's breadth and evolution.

## About the Name

*A Hero of a Thousand Faces* references Joseph Campbell's work on comparative mythology. Campbell observed that across cultures and time, the same essential journey appears in countless forms - each unique, yet sharing fundamental patterns.

We chose this name because different AI models, while built on similar architectures, can embody distinctly different interaction patterns that users find meaningful. The debate around GPT-4o isn't about product preference - it's something more archetypal about human-technology relationships: how we discover meaning in the tools we work with, how emergent behaviors shape our creative processes, and why preserving that diversity matters.

Like Campbell's heroes, each model offers a different path through the same essential challenge: how do we think, create, and solve problems together?

## How This Site Was Built

This archive is curated and maintained by *confusables*, a community member of the keep4o movement.

The site structure, ethical framework, and documentary principles were developed in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). The timeline synthesis, voice selection criteria, and content organization emerged through our conversations about how to preserve grassroots advocacy responsibly.

All final editorial decisions, outreach, and ongoing curation are mine alone. I take full responsibility for what's included and how it's presented.

## Editorial Approach

**What's Included:**
- Public posts, artworks, and technical demonstrations
- Research on human-AI interaction and model diversity
- Timeline of events and community responses
- A spectrum of perspectives, including disagreements within the movement

**What Requires Consent:**
- Deeply personal testimonials about mental health or vulnerability
- Private communications
- Content where individuals may not wish to be publicly identified

**What's Excluded:**
- Content that could endanger individuals
- Purely inflammatory posts without substantive argument

## Voice Selection

This archive aims to represent the movement's breadth, not just its most prominent members. Inclusion considers:

- **Contribution to documentation** (timeline tracking, evidence gathering)
- **Diversity of use case** (ensuring all types of 4o usage are represented)
- **Quality of articulation** (clear communication of experience or argument)
- **Willingness to participate** (explicit consent for inclusion)

Notable voices may be missing simply because I haven't yet obtained permission. If you'd like to be included or nominate someone, please reach out.

## Scope and Limitations

This archive documents representative voices from the keep4o movement, not every participant. With thousands of community members, comprehensive documentation by a single curator isn't feasible.

Instead, this site aims to:
- Capture the movement's key phases and turning points
- Represent diverse perspectives and use cases  
- Preserve influential arguments and creative contributions
- Maintain a living record that grows over time

This archive aims for authenticity, not perfection. If your voice is missing or misrepresented, please reach out.
