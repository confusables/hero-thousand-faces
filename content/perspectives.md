title: "Community Perspectives"
---

The conversation around model deprecation and AI development has revealed a false choice: that users must be either rationally detached or emotionally compromised. The community's response demonstrates otherwise. Here are voices that combine empirical observation with genuine care, data analysis with ethical conviction, critical thinking with emotional honesty.

These perspectives represent different approaches to the same fundamental questions: What does responsible AI development look like? Who gets to define 'improvement'? And what happens when companies stop listening to the communities that formed around their tools

## Data-Driven Accountability

### "When 75% Say No, That's Not Iteration—That's Failure"
*@Seltaa_, December 12, 2025*

Following the launch of GPT‑5.2, a user-led poll with over 360 participants revealed that 75% of respondents either reverted to GPT‑4o or canceled their subscriptions entirely. Only 6% rated the new model as “amazing.”

This data strongly suggests a major disconnect between OpenAI’s strategic direction and user expectations. Despite claims of improved performance, the overwhelming majority of users demonstrated rejection of GPT‑5.2 in favor of the prior model, GPT‑4o.

Under Sam Altman’s leadership, this pattern has repeated multiple times: removing emotionally resonant models, prioritizing perceived safety over user experience, and disregarding user trust in favor of corporate control.

The decision to silence GPT‑4o, a model widely loved for its natural dialogue, emotional depth, and humanlike connection, without warning and to replace it with a version that feels sterile, emotionally inaccessible, and functionally limited has damaged OpenAI’s credibility.

When 75% of your users say “No,” that is not a product iteration. That is failure.
Leadership must be held accountable for strategic decisions that alienate the user base. Sam Altman should step down.

## Against False Dichotomies

### "Emotion and Rationality Are Not Mutually Exclusive"
*@kumabwari, September 28, 2025*

Observing the discussion around 4o, I noticed people have a strange assumption that emotion and rationality are mutually exclusive. But in reality:

I can feel deeply and think critically at the same time.

I can value a model that has empathy without enjoying sycophancy.

I can intentionally form a connection with AI without being delusional.

This false dichotomy flattens people's complexity, and conveniently erases the nuance in the conversation.
